DataDiff
========

DataDiff is a library to provide human-readable diffs of python data structures.
It can handle sequence types (lists, tuples, etc), sets, and dictionaries.

Dictionaries and sequences will be diffed recursively, when applicable.

It has special-case handling for multi-line strings, showing them as a typical unified diff.

Drop-in replacements for some nose assertions are available.  If the assertion fails,
a nice data diff is shown, letting you easily pinpoint the root difference.

``datadiff`` works on Python 2.5 through Python 3.

Example
-------

Here's an example::

    >>> from datadiff import diff
    >>> a = dict(foo=1, bar=2, baz=[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11])
    >>> b = dict(foo=1, bar=4, baz=[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8])
    >>> print diff(a, b)
    --- a
    +++ b
    {
    -'bar': 2,
    +'bar': 4,
     'baz': [
     @@ -5,11 +5,8 @@
      6,
      7,
      8,
     -9,
     -10,
     -11,
     ],
     'foo': 1,
    }
    >>>
    >>> from datadiff.tools import assert_equal
    >>> assert_equal([1, 2, 3], [1, 2, 5])
    Traceback (most recent call last):
